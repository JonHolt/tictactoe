#Tic Tac Toe AI

----
## Dependencies
* [Python 3.2](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.2/python-3.2.msi)
* [PyGame 1.9.2a](http://pygame.org/ftp/pygame-1.9.2a0.win32-py3.2.msi)

----
## Usage
For students who want to play around with the code and make changes I recommend [PyScripter](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyscripter/files/latest/download).

Otherwise just run main.py and have fun!

NOTE: The AI takes a little time to make its first move. Please don't click more than once at the beginning or you might make more than one move.

If you want to play with two human players set AI_GAME to False.

----
## Goals
1. Optimize first turn to minimize delay
2. Prevent player clicks from registering on AI turn
